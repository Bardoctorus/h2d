# A Super Simple Hex/Dec/Binary converter on the command line

I shamelessly ripped the code from here as a starting point:
https://aticleworld.com/c-program-to-convert-hexadecimal-to-decimal/

# Installation

For now there aint none. Download it, compile it, place it in your PATH.

# Usage

For now it's just the program from the site above, so you enter a hex number and it gets converted to decimal.

# TODO

- Add a loop to continue the program until a quit command -[x]
- Oh god fix the loop its incrementing the answers in some wild way -[ ]
- MAke quit command work []
- Add octal and binary to output [ ]
- Add input choice so you can input any one and get the conversion from any of the others. [ ]
